## Core Concept
A simulation-first sandbox environment where actors (including the player) can live and interact within a complex, systemic world.

## Key Principles

### 1. Simulation Priority
- The world operates on consistent rules applied equally to all entities
- Emphasis on emergent gameplay arising from complex system interactions

### 2. Actor Equality
- No fundamental distinction between player and AI-controlled actors
- All actors have the same capabilities and are subject to the same rules

### 3. Systemic World Design
- Focus on creating interrelated systems rather than scripted events
- Environmental factors (e.g., weather, resources) affect all aspects of the simulation

### 4. Emergent Narrative
- Stories and events emerge from the interactions between actors and the world
- Minimal pre-scripted narrative elements

### 5. Deep Interaction
- Actors can meaningfully impact and change the world
- Actions have lasting consequences on the environment and other actors

### 6. Autonomy and AI
- Non-player actors have high degrees of autonomy in decision-making
- AI should be capable of long-term planning and adapting to changing world states

### 7. Persistent and Evolving World
- The world continues to evolve even without player intervention
- Long-term consequences for actions and changes in the world

### 8. Sandbox Freedom
- Players are free to set their own goals and playstyles
- Multiple valid approaches to challenges with no prescribed "correct" path

### 9. Systemic Complexity
- Interlocking systems create a complex but understandable world
- Emphasis on learning and mastering how systems interact

### 10. Moddability and Extensibility
- Design systems with moddability in mind
- Allow for easy extension of the simulation with new elements

## Technical Goals

### 1. Scalable Architecture
- Design for potentially large, complex worlds
- Efficient handling of numerous autonomous actors

### 2. Robust Simulation Engine
- Capable of managing and updating multiple interconnected systems
- Consistent physics and rule enforcement across the simulation

### 3. Advanced AI Systems
- Implement sophisticated decision-making for non-player actors
- AI should be able to form long-term plans and adapt to changing circumstances

### 4. Efficient Data Management
- Handle large amounts of persistent data for the evolving world
- Optimize for quick saving and loading of complex world states

### 5. Modular Design
- Create systems that are easily expandable and moddable
- Clear interfaces between different parts of the simulation

## Current Development Status
Core development active, focusing on foundational systems.

## Core Principles

### 1. Simulation Priority
- Realistic, systemic behavior for all entities
- No scripted behaviors, all actions emerge from system interactions

### 2. Actor Equality
- No fundamental distinction between player and AI-controlled actors
- Same capabilities and limitations for all actors

### 3. Emergent Complexity
- Complex behaviors arise from simple, interacting systems
- No hardcoded "AI packages" or behavior trees

### 4. Adaptability
- Actors learn and adapt based on experiences
- Dynamic response to changing world conditions

### 5. Moddability
- Easy to extend and modify all AI systems
- Clear interfaces for adding new behaviors

## System Components

### 1. Needs System
- Based on Maslow's hierarchy
- Categories:
  - Physiological (hunger, thirst, rest)
  - Safety (shelter, health, security)
  - Social (companionship, belonging)
  - Esteem (recognition, achievement)
  - Self-Actualization (growth, creativity)
- Each need has:
  - Current value
  - Decay rate
  - Importance modifier
  - Satisfaction thresholds

### 2. Goal System
- Goals tied to specific needs
- Hierarchy:
  - Immediate (satisfy urgent needs)
  - Short-term (solve current problems)
  - Long-term (improve overall situation)
- Dynamic priority calculation based on:
  - Current need states
  - Environmental conditions
  - Past experiences
  - Personality traits

### 3. Memory and Knowledge
- Episodic memory:
  - Significant events
  - Important interactions
  - Success/failure experiences
- Semantic memory:
  - World knowledge
  - Learned facts
  - Understanding of systems
- Procedural memory:
  - Learned skills
  - Action patterns
  - Success strategies

### 4. Decision Making
- Utility-based action selection
- Factors considered:
  - Current needs
  - Active goals
  - Past experiences
  - Environmental state
  - Available resources
  - Risk assessment

### 5. Learning and Adaptation
- Experience tracking
- Behavior pattern adjustment
- Knowledge update system
- Success/failure analysis

### 6. Personality System
- Big Five trait implementation:
  - Openness
  - Conscientiousness
  - Extraversion
  - Agreeableness
  - Neuroticism
- Influence on:
  - Need priorities
  - Goal selection
  - Risk assessment
  - Social interactions

### 7. Emotion System
- Basic emotion set
- Influences on decision making
- Mood tracking
- Social contagion

### 8. Social Interaction
- Relationship tracking
- Group dynamics
- Social need fulfillment
- Cooperation/competition decisions

### 9. World Interaction
- Environment sensing
- Resource discovery
- Territory awareness
- Path planning

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Basic needs system
2. Simple goal selection
3. Core decision making
4. Basic world interaction

### Phase 2: Enhancement
1. Memory system
2. Learning capabilities
3. Personality influence
4. Enhanced social interaction

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Complex emotional modeling
2. Long-term planning
3. Advanced learning
4. Group dynamics

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Efficient need calculation
- Smart update scheduling
- Memory optimization
- Decision caching

### Scalability
- Support for many active actors
- Efficient state storage
- Parallel processing where possible

### Moddability
- Clear interface definitions
- Event-driven architecture
- Data-driven design
- Extension points
